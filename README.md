# SDEV-143 Knowledge Base
**Course Project: Personal Implementation of a Git and GitHub Knowledge Base**

## Project Overview
This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my work and learning materials throughout the SDEV-143 course. It is designed to demonstrate proficiency in distributed version control using Git and collaborative workflows on GitHub.

## Repository Structure
To manage cognitive load and maintain organization, the repository is structured as follows:

* **`/Module-Subfolders` (e.g., Module-01, Module-02):** Contains weekly work, including screenshots of completed tasks, text-based notes, and README files detailing module-specific learning.
* **`/Journals`:** A dedicated space for my weekly reflective journal entries, archived here to maintain a complete history of my progress.
* **`/Project-Videos`:** A collection of video demonstrations recorded at each milestone (Modules 2, 4, 6, and 8) showing command-line tasks and version control workflows.

## Knowledge Base Goals
* **Version Control:** Tracking the evolution of course assignments using Git.
* **Documentation:** Archiving reference materials and links for future development use.
* **Evidence of Learning:** Providing a clear "Change Log" and history of all tasks undertaken during the semester.
