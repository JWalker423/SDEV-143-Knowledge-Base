merge basics
copy commits from one branch to another
git is distributed no file locking system
multiple people edit same file simultaneously
merge only when work is final
pull is fetch command plus merge command
behind means remote repository has new commits
fast forward merge
occurs when branches stay on same timeline
git moves head pointer to latest commit
cleanest history log method
use git log --oneline --graph to see branch tree
merge conflicts
same line of code changed in two different ways
auto merge fails and requires manual choice
terminal enters merging state
git status lists unmerged files
git merge --abort cancels merge and returns to previous state
conflict markers
<<<<<<< HEAD start of local changes
======= divider between versions
>>>>>>> end of incoming changes
resolution steps
open file and edit code manually
delete all marker lines from file
git add to stage fixed file
git commit to finalize merge process
keep default merge message unless company policy differs
branch management
git commit -m skips text editor for messages
git branch -D deletes merged branches to clean log
git diff branch1..branch2 reviews changes before merging
always check location with git status before starting merge

pushing after resolution
pushing copies local commits to remote branch
push works like pull but in reverse direction
normal pushes use fast-forward and require no merge commit
push develop using git push origin develop
never change history of commits already pushed to remote
pre-merge review
review all changes before attempting merge to save time
check location with git status or git branch
checkout target branch before merging into it
use git checkout master followed by git merge develop
use git diff master..develop to see differences between branches
pull requests on github also provide visual change reviews
merging types
merging is pouring one branch into another
fast-forward occurs if parent branch has no new commits
fast-forward moves pointer and appends commits to parent
three-way merge occurs if parent branch has received commits
three-way merge creates new merge commit with two parents
conflicts occur if same line modified in both branches
reducing conflicts
avoid committing directly to master or develop branches
use pull requests for all changes even when working alone
keep pull requests focused on one specific issue or bug
avoid do-it-all pull requests to prevent complex conflicts
standardize line endings to unix-style across different systems
agree on team formatting for indentation and whitespace
merge management
formatting differences often cause unnecessary conflicts
use git merge --abort to cancel merge and fix formatting first
aborting keeps current state and does not destroy commits
visual git tools and IDE extensions help resolve conflicts easier
text editors often break color schemes during merge markers
summary
merging moves commits between branches
fast-forward and three-way are main merge types
good workflows and pull requests minimize conflict frequency
use specialized tools for better visibility of code changes
